Section 2
---------
The Purpose of this section is to deal with some server side logic:

for that please use php, lavarel framework (https://laravel.com/) and mysql:

write server side api that loads data from mysql
1. Add login screen ( html screen ) that will invoke login api in the server side 

POST /login
json body {user,password}

returns 200 in case of success and 401 in case that the user and password do not matched in db

in case of successful login, then redirect to /dashboard page ( the page that yo wrote in scection 1 )

2. the dashbaord will load the data of the messages from the server side

GET /messages
will retrive the data from messages table


DB tables

users:
user
password

messages
message_title
message_body
message_time
