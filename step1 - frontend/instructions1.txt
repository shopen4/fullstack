Section 1
---------
The purpose of this test is to check the UI capabilities ( HTML and CSS)

The test is to create HTML page like screen1.png

* No framework are allowed (no bootstrap) - you should use pure html and css
* The 2 graphs of "orders" and "Transactions WorldWide" should be static images that scraped from screen1.png
* The Bars of "Total Orders in period", "Orders in last month", "Monthly income from orders" should be implemented by you.

Please remember that the execution time is being measured.

Good Luck!
